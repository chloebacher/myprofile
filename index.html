				I am currently a member of the Rotary Club at ESSEC, and as a head of communication I lead a team of 6 people to develop social media content, and a platform to connect with organizations to advocate for humanitarian causes around the world. I am also involved at the Scool&Co club at ESSEC. I work weekly on homework sessions with elementary school students at a low-income shelter.

				<light> I speak <strong> French </strong> 🇫🇷 and <strong>English</strong> 🇺🇸 fluently as I was born and raised in France and have spent my high school journey in an american high school. I have always loved the <strong> Spanish </strong> 🇪🇸 language and culture, and have been studying developing my language skills for 10 years.
